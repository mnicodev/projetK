Mailjet Module - Drupal 8.x.
===========================

Mailjet APIv3 module for Drupal 8.x.

This module for Drupal 8.x. provides complete control of Drupal Email 
settings with Mailjet and also adds specific Drupal Commerce email marketing 
functionality such as triggered marketing emails and marketing campaign revenue statistics.

The Mailjet Module for Drupal 8.x configures your default Drupal SMTP 
settings to use Mailjet's SMTP relay with enhanced deliverability and 
tracking. The module also provides the ability to synchronise your Drupal 
opt-in contacts and send bulk and targeted emails to them with real time 
statistics including opens, clicks, geography, average time to click, unsubs, etc. 

Mailjet is a powerful all-in-one email service provider used to get maximum 
insight and deliverability results from both  marketing and transactional 
emails. Our analytics tools and intelligent APIs give senders the best 
understanding of how to maximize benefits for each individual contact and 
campaign email after email.

    where you can see how good is your conversion rate, click the “Done” 
    button on the bottom of 
    the email text area, and click “Continue”, in the next step which is the 
    last one you can choose 
    to send the email now or schedule it for later, click “Save and send”.
6.  If you enable the stats module 2 menu items will appear Dashboard where 
    you can see the results of the mail campaigns and the Mailjet ROI stats,
    clicking the ROI statsyou can see the actual conversion of your campaigns,
    this feature will display a view which will present the campaign name, 
    number of orders made by users who clicked on the link of your site in your email campaign.
7. My account menu item will redirect you to the mailjet logging page.
8. Upgrade menu link will redirect you to the pricing list of mailjet where 
    you can pick up a plan and upgrade your account.
9. The contacts menu item allows you to create lists that can be used for your campaigns.
    If you click on Contacts the list of all contact lists will be displayed on the top right 
    side of the screen a button for creating a new contact list is available => Create a contact list.
